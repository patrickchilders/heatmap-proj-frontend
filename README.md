# heatmap-proj-frontend
Heatmap mini-portfolio project frontend made with react.

react-redux is included, but there are not enough states to need to keep track of with a store/reduces/middleware

## Libraries Used

### leaflet (react-leaflet)
Leaflet was recommended, and also seemed to be the easiest to use of the mapping tools I could find.
I made using it easier by installing a react-leaflet package.

### leaflet.heat
This is not a react wrapper like react-leaflet.
It was compiled from source and included in this project as a precompiled module.
